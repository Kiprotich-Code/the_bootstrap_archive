# About

-> The Bootstrap Archive is a comprehensive collection of curated and well-organized HTML templates built using the Bootstrap framework. This repository serves as a valuable resource for developers, designers, and anyone looking to kickstart their web projects with modern, responsive, and customizable templates.

# Contains

-> All repositories are named according to the order they're created, starting with the prefix "ar" to stand for "archive" followed by an underscore and a number(should be next to the previous committed file) i.e ar_1 , ar_2 .... ar_n

# Contributions

-> The goal is to have an archive of common bootstrap templates that can be re-used in the future either for learning purposes or for prototyping. All contributors should follow the naming conventions mentioned in the 'Contain' session above. All the files should be accompanied by a detailed 'README.md' file at the root. The target is to have atleast #100 template by December 2023, so your effort would be much welcome. Reach out so I can add you up as a contributor.

# Features
